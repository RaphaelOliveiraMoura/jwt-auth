# JWT Authentication Node.js Tutorial with GraphQL and React

This is a project made by `Ben Awad` in a youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25GS0MLT8JU&t=1303s)

I watched the video and build this repository to practice and memorize the content present in the video.

Is important say that I'm learning english too, so probably I'll write a lot of words wrong.
